# 16 The Game Rules 

## Bricks
In the game we have bricks that range from the values 1 to 16. We have 6 bricks of each value, which makes in total 96 bricks. 

## Set up
In the beginning all the 96 bricks are plased in a urn and after this they are individually taken out of the urn. This way we draw a random brick each time.

## Lanes 
 Then we have 4 "lanes" in which we can play the bricks. A brick drawn from the urn, can be placed in all lanes initially but after the initial placing, the moving of the bricks has to follow the rules of movement.

## Rules of movement 
To move bricks or multiple brick the bricks have to be in order lets say we have bricks 5-4-3 on lane 1 and on lane 2 we have 16-13-6. In this case we can move 5-4-3 on top of the brick 6 on lane 2. In essense the bricks that are moved have to be in order from largest to smallest and there is not missing brick in between. for example if we have 8-7-5-4-3 this can no be moved on a 9 on another lane, because the brick 6 is missing. the brick 16 is the only brick that can after the initial placing be placed on a empty lane. 

## Piles
The essence of the game is to get all the bricks in order in 6 different piles so that they are in the order 1-16. So if we have a pile with 4 on it we can place a 5 on it. The Goal of the game is to at the end have all 6 piles up to 16 and no bricks in play.
